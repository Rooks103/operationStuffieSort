# operationStuffieSort
My daughter wanted a method of remembering her stuffies names (since she has too many) and I wanted to learn something about Go and Kubernetes. 

Concept initially is to create a Go web UI that's capable of getting input of a picture with a name and some labels. UI will also need a search by name or label. 

That will get stored into a local K8ssandra cluster.
